This project is my first personal portfolio website, developed as part of the Internet Technology subject in my 1st semester. The website is designed to introduce myself, showcase my basic skills, and present my academic background in a structured and user-friendly way.

The project uses fundamental web development technologies to demonstrate my understanding of core concepts such as webpage structure, styling, and basic interactivity. It helped me learn how websites are built, organized, and deployed.

This portfolio marks the beginning of my journey in web development and serves as a foundation for future improvements and advanced projects.
